## Course Description
This course introduces multimedia elements (multimodal components) including image, graphics, sound, and video components.
In related with the multimedia elements, students learn the fundamental of multimedia processing.
By teaching not only fundamental technologies but also emerging technologies (e.g., deep learning with multimedia processing), the course helps and encourages students to develop their imaginative and creative skills.

## Course Policies
### Course Communication
KLMS is the main source of communication. If you are looking for more information on the lecture, check out the lecture syllabus. 
Also find out about any new announcements or changes to class on KLMS.

### Missed Classes
The student is responsible for obtaining material distributed on class days when he/she was absent. 
This can be done through contacting a classmate who was present or by contacting the instructor during his office hours or other times. 
Missed or late quizzes cannot be made up under any circumstances but with good cause and adequate notice, an early quiz may be given.

### Assignments
All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date due. Late submission of assignments will be assessed a penalty of 10% per day. No exceptions are made.

### Academic Dishonesty
Plagiarism and cheating are serious offenses and may be punished by failure on exam or assignments; failure in course; and or expulsion from the University.

### Need for Assistance
If you have any condition, such as a physical or learning disability, which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work that is outlined, 
or which will require academic accommodations, please notify the professor as soon as possible.
